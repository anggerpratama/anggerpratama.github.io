                This project is an online marketplace application developed specifically for the Government of Mojokerto
                City, Indonesia. The platform is designed to empower local businesses and MSMEs (Micro, Small, and
                Medium Enterprises) by providing a dedicated digital space to showcase and sell their products. Unlike
                generic e-commerce solutions, this marketplace focuses on promoting local products and supporting the
                economic growth of the Mojokerto community.
                <br> <br>
                The application offers a comprehensive set of features comparable to those found in major marketplace
                platforms, including product listings, secure transactions, order management, and user-friendly
                interfaces for both buyers and sellers. By prioritizing local products and vendors, the platform ensures
                that the benefits of digital commerce are accessible to small businesses and entrepreneurs in the
                region. This initiative not only streamlines the buying and selling process but also strengthens the
                local economy by connecting consumers directly with Mojokerto's diverse range of goods and services.

            <h2>Key Feature</h2>
            <p>
                Mojosadean offers a robust set of features to facilitate local commerce, including comprehensive Product
                Listing capabilities for MSMEs to showcase their goods, an Intuitive Seller Dashboard for efficient
                product and stock management, Realtime Messaging (Chat) to enable direct communication between buyers
                and sellers, and full Mobile Readiness via a dedicated Android application, ensuring accessibility and a
                seamless experience on the go.
            </p>
            <h3>Product Listing</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/homepage.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/homepage3.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/homepage2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The product listing feature enables sellers to easily add, manage, and display their products within the
                marketplace. Each product entry includes detailed information such as product name, description, price,
                images, and stock availability. The intuitive interface allows sellers to upload multiple images and
                categorize their products for better discoverability. Buyers can browse through organized product
                categories, view product details, and search for specific items using filters and keywords. This
                streamlined listing process ensures that local businesses can effectively showcase their offerings and
                reach a wider audience within the Mojokerto community.
            </p>
            <h3>Seller Dashboard</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/tenant1.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/tenantorder.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/tenantproduct.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/tenantstock.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The Seller Dashboard is a centralized interface designed to help sellers efficiently manage their online
                store within the marketplace. Through the dashboard, sellers can add new products, update product
                details, and monitor inventory levels with ease. The product management tools allow for quick editing of
                product information, uploading images, and organizing items into categories for better visibility.
                <br> <br>
                A key feature of the dashboard is the product stock management system, which enables sellers to track
                stock levels in real time. Sellers can easily adjust stock quantities, receive notifications for low
                inventory, and view stock history to ensure they never run out of popular items. This streamlined
                process simplifies inventory control and helps prevent overselling.
                <br> <br>
                Additionally, the dashboard provides a comprehensive order management section where sellers can view
                incoming orders, update order statuses, and communicate with buyers. Sellers can track each order from
                placement to fulfillment, ensuring timely processing and delivery. These features collectively empower
                sellers to operate their businesses more efficiently and provide a seamless experience for their
                customers.
            </p>

            <h3>Realtime Messaging (Chat)</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/chats1.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/chats2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The realtime messaging (chat) feature enables seamless communication between buyers and sellers directly
                within the marketplace platform. Users can initiate conversations regarding products, negotiate prices,
                or clarify order details without leaving the application. The chat system supports instant message
                delivery, ensuring that both parties receive updates in real time. This feature enhances trust and
                transparency, allowing for quick resolution of questions or issues and improving the overall buying and
                selling experience. Additionally, message history is securely stored, so users can reference previous
                conversations as needed throughout the transaction process.
            </p>

            <h3>Mobile Ready (Android)</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/mojosadean/mobileready.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The marketplace application is designed to be mobile-ready, ensuring a seamless user experience on
                Android
                devices. The responsive design adapts to various screen sizes, providing users with easy access to all
                features, including product browsing, order management, and messaging. The mobile interface is optimized
                for touch interactions, allowing users to navigate the platform effortlessly. This mobile compatibility
                enables sellers to manage their stores on the go and buyers to shop conveniently from their smartphones,
                enhancing accessibility and engagement with the marketplace.

            <p>
                Mojosadean is developed with a robust and flexible web technology stack tailored for managing product
                listings, user interactions, and transaction workflows. The frontend is built using
                <strong>NuxtJS</strong>, enabling
                server-side rendering and smooth navigation, while <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> ensures a responsive and
                user-friendly interface. The backend utilizes <strong>Express JS</strong> written in
                <strong>TypeScript</strong>, providing strong typing and maintainability for complex business logic.
