                This project is a centralized management application developed specifically for the "Biro Kerjasama" of
                the East
                Java Provincial Government, Indonesia. The platform is designed to accommodate and streamline all types
                of inter-agency
                and institutional collaborations across the entire East Java region. By providing a unified system, the
                application
                enables efficient tracking, documentation, and administration of various cooperation agreements,
                ensuring that all
                partnership activities are well-coordinated and accessible in one place. This centralized approach
                supports better
                governance, transparency, and ease of monitoring for all collaborative initiatives managed by the
                provincial government.

            </p>

            <h2>Key Feature</h2>
            <p>
                The SIMASKER application offers a comprehensive suite of features, including dynamic custom form input
                creation with support for various field types and master data integration, logical grouping of form
                inputs with configurable workflows and access permissions, granular user access control for enhanced
                security and tailored user experiences, customizable document flow statuses to support unique approval
                processes, and an interactive dashboard that delivers real-time insights and key metrics for efficient
                monitoring and analysis of collaboration activities.
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Form Input</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/formbuilder.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/formbuilder2.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/formbuilder3.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The main feature of this application is its fully custom form input system, which empowers
                administrators to design
                and deploy dynamic forms tailored to the specific needs of each collaboration or agreement. The form
                builder supports up to 85% of standard form controls, including text fields, numbers, dates, checkboxes,
                radio buttons, file uploads, and more. <br> <br>

                A standout capability is the ability to add new "select" fields that can dynamically fetch their
                selection options from master data references. This ensures that dropdown choices remain consistent and
                up-to-date across the system, streamlining data entry and reducing errors. Administrators can easily
                configure these select fields to pull options from centralized datasets, making the forms highly
                adaptable and scalable for various use cases within the provincial government.
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Form Group</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/groupformbuilder.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/groupformbuilder2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                This feature allows administrators to organize individual form inputs into logical groups, making it
                easier to
                manage complex data collection processes. After creating custom form inputs, administrators can use the
                form
                group builder to define how these inputs are grouped together, specify the document flow
                (such as approval steps or review stages), and assign user access permissions for each group.
                <br> <br>

                By enabling grouping and workflow configuration, this feature ensures that each collaboration or
                agreement
                follows a structured process, with clear roles and responsibilities for different users. It streamlines
                document management, enhances security by controlling access, and supports efficient collaboration
                across departments.
            </p>

            <h3>Custom User Access</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/dynamichakakses.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/dynamichakakses2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                A core feature of the application is the ability to customize user access at a granular level.
                Administrators can define specific permissions for each user or user group, controlling access to
                individual menus and document entries within the system. This means that access to sensitive data,
                forms, or workflow steps can be restricted based on roles or responsibilities, ensuring that users only
                see and interact with the information relevant to their duties.
                <br> <br>

                This dynamic access control not only enhances security but also streamlines the user experience by
                presenting each user with a tailored interface. Whether managing collaboration agreements, reviewing
                documents, or configuring forms, every action and menu can be precisely assigned, making the platform
                highly adaptable to the organizational structure and workflow requirements of the East Java Provincial
                Government.
            </p>

            <h3>Custom Document Flow Status</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/dynamicstatus.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/dynamicstatus2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                This feature empowers administrators to define and customize the document flow approval statuses for
                each type of collaboration or agreement. Instead of being limited to a fixed set of status options,
                administrators can create, edit, and sequence custom statuses that reflect the unique approval processes
                of their organization. <br> <br>

                For example, a document might progress through statuses such as "Draft," "Submitted," "Under Review,"
                "Approved by Supervisor," and "Finalized." Each status can be configured with its own label, color, and
                associated permissions, ensuring that only authorized users can move documents between specific stages.
                <br> <br>

                This flexibility allows the system to adapt to evolving workflows and organizational requirements,
                supporting complex approval chains and multi-step reviews. By making the document flow fully
                configurable, the application ensures transparency, accountability, and precise control over every stage
                of the approval process.<br> <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Dashboard Report</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/simasker/dashboard.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The dashboard report provides a comprehensive overview of all collaboration activities and agreements
                managed within the system. It features interactive charts and summary widgets that display key metrics
                such as the number of active agreements, pending approvals, completed collaborations, and user activity
                statistics. Administrators can filter data by date range, department, or agreement type to gain
                actionable insights and monitor progress in real time. This centralized reporting tool helps
                decision-makers quickly identify trends, track performance, and ensure that all processes are running
                smoothly across the organization.
            </p>
