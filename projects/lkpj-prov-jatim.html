                This project is a web application developed for the East Java Provincial Government of Indonesia, 
                specifically for the "Biro Otonomi Daerah" (Regional Autonomy Bureau). 
                Its main purpose is to streamline and facilitate the reporting process of performance and activities 
                from all "OPD" (Regional Government Organizations) across East Java. 
                By digitizing the reporting workflow, the application helps ensure transparency, accountability, 
                and efficiency in government operations, making it easier for the bureau to monitor, evaluate, 
                and manage the performance data submitted by each OPD.

            </p>

            <h2>Key Feature</h2>
            <p>
                The application offers several essential features, including secure user authentication, 
                role-based access for different OPDs, dynamic custom table input for flexible data entry, 
                real-time validation, and a comprehensive dashboard for data recapitulation and analysis. 
                These features are designed to simplify the reporting process, improve data accuracy, 
                and provide actionable insights for government administrators.
            </p>
            <h3>Custom Table Input</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/lkpj/customtable1.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/lkpj/customtable2.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The application's main feature is a custom table that allows users to easily input and manage data related to 
                the performance and activities of each OPD. This table is designed to be user-friendly, enabling 
                quick data entry and retrieval, which is essential for efficient reporting and analysis. 
                Additionally, the custom table supports specific user access for each OPD, ensuring that users can only view and 
                manage data relevant to their own organization. This access control enhances data security and streamlines the workflow for each OPD.
            </p>
            <h3>Recapitulation Dashboard</h3>
            <div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2 mb-2">
                <img src="/images/projects/lkpj/rekapitulation.png" alt="">
                <img src="/images/projects/lkpj/rekapitulationdashboard.png" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>
                The recapitulation dashboard serves as a centralized summary of all data entries submitted through the dynamic custom tables by each OPD. 
                It aggregates and visualizes key metrics, allowing administrators and stakeholders to quickly review overall performance, identify trends, 
                and compare results across different organizations. This feature streamlines the evaluation process by presenting consolidated data in an accessible format, 
                supporting informed decision-making and more effective monitoring of government activities.
            </p>

            <h2>Web Tech Stack</h2>
            <p>
                The application is built using a modern web technology stack to ensure scalability, flexibility, and a seamless 
                user experience. The frontend leverages <strong>NuxtJS</strong> for server-side rendering and efficient routing, 
                combined with <strong>Bootstrap 5</strong> for responsive and consistent UI components. On the backend, <strong>Express JS</strong> 
                is used as the web server framework, written in <strong>TypeScript</strong> to provide type safety and maintainable code. 
                Data is stored in <strong>MongoDB</strong>, which enables fully custom and dynamic table input, allowing users to define and manage 
                flexible data structures as needed. This stack empowers the application to handle complex data entry requirements while maintaining high performance and reliability.
